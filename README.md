# Django-Chat-app
Made a real time chat application using Django
sqlite database was used with ajax to refresh the incoming chats so the whole page doesnt keep reloading again.
The basic work structure is that a person enters a room name he wants to enter along with his user name and the person in the sam room can message each others in real time.
